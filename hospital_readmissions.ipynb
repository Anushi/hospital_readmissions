    "# SYD DAT 4 Project : Hospital Readmissions prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "I had an opportunity to work as a software engineer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,US where I was involved in biomedical research projects. It is very gratifying as a computer science person to help solve interesting and challenging health care problems, which is why I choose this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospital readmission means when a patient is re-admitted to a hospital within short period(usually 28/30 days)after first time or initial discharge. Such readmissions are major health care concern for most countries like US, UK, Australia and many others. This leads to increased wait times, increased medical errors resulting in risking patient safety and unncessary deaths. High readmission rate is infact an indicator of poor quality care of the hospital. It also puts huge monetary burden on the hospitals as well as the government. In this project, I want to identify patients who are likely to be readmitted to the hospital. By doing this, proper care and management of such patients can be planned by their care providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal(s) : \n",
    "Predict if a patient will be readmitted to the hospital or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data set used : \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve the above goal(s), I need a hospital data set that has records of all hospitalizations entries for its patients for certain number of years. It should contain information like why the patients were admitted, which department they were admitted for, how many times they were admitted, what medications they were on, what lab tests were conducted, how many days they stayed in hospital, vitals signs like heights/weights, age, race, blood pressure, smoking status, their electronic medical records, billing records, genetics data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it's hard to obtain such a heterogeneous dataset which is publicly available as patient data are very confidential. Though there are quite a few data sets that contain substantial information and after going through some of them, I decided to use \"Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a public available database by Center for Clinical and Translational Research, Virginia Commonwealth University. This data is a de-identified abstract of the Health Facts database (Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, MO). It contains 10 years of diabetes patients data across 130 US hospitals.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Summary of data : \n",
    "\n",
    "From the below python code, following observations are made :-\n",
    " * There are 50 features and 101766 observations(hospitalizations). \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * Each row in dataframe represents one hospital admission. On an average, there are 5 hospitalizations for each patient (patient_nbr is the de-identifed patient ID).\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * In the dataset, \"readmitted\" is the target varible with three classes :\n",
    " \n",
    " NO means never readmitted (~54% of total dataset)\n",
    " \n",
    " &lt;30 means readmitted within 30 days (~11% of total dataset)\n",
    " \n",
    " &gt;30 means readmitted after 30 days (~35% of total dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * To start with a simple binary classification model, I am grouping &lt;30 and &gt;30 classes of readmitted target varible into one class \"1\", which means the patient is readmitted anytime. And class NO is \"0\" means patient is never readmitted. Also this gives even distribution between binary classes. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * Several patients have multiple hospitalizations, so I have used only the first admission and predict whether they will be re-admitted or not. This gives 71518 unique patient hospitalizations.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * Numeric features are : time_in_hospital, num_medications,num_lab_procedures, num_procedures, number_outpatient, number_inpatient, number_diagnoses. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * The average amount of time spent(time_in_hospital) in a hospital is 4 days and there is a good variation in this feature ranging from 1 day to 14 days.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * Number of lab procedures conducted during the stay is on an average 43, and it ranges from 1 to 132.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * The average number of medications administered is 16 with minimum 1 and maximum of 81 medications.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * Many features have non-numeric values, e.g.: race, gender, age is in range, medications like citoglipton, insulin, diag_1, diag_2, diag_3, etc,. So need to transform them.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * Weight feature has 97% data missing, so I will not include it. I am not sure if it makes sense to impute such large missing data. May be better off by excluding that feature for the time being.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling techniques : \n",
    "\n",
    "* As of now I have used only numeric features for classification and used logistic regression, regularized logistic regression and decision trees methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* My next step is to transform non-numeric features into categorical(nominal) values and add them into the models. Some them I think are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try out other models like KNN classfication, random forests, SVM, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question : Several non-numeric features have more than 3 categories. Does it make sense to binarize them all to be used in classic logistic regression? Or better off using models that would accept categorical features without binarizing them?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations : \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the main goal of the project is to use a modelling technique to predict patient readmission, but if time permits I would to like make some dashboard so that hospitals or clinicians can use to visualize data for their patients.\n",
